TimThumb.php ReWorked

WARNING!!! 
THIS SCRIPT SHOULD NOT BE USED ON PUBLIC SERVERS!!!


Today I found that TimThumb was dropped by its creator due to a major security hole discovered that destroyed many sites.I used it sparingly on a few of my local sites so I have yet to suffer any losses or attacks. I am only posting this code in fear of it disapearing and not getting an idea of what can be done to possibly fix security leaks or just used in private networks securely.
